' high score library

' Library of functions for handling a high score file, display and name capture
' Deals with both time and score based setups, and either low or high = best setups.

' NOTE, this expects that you're using "OPTION ORDER 1" for the arrays
' these are variables needed through the High Score system. We prefix them so there (hopefully) isn't a name collision

'note, you need to save this file as a .bas to run it!
' As an .inc then this needs to be commented out!!!!
